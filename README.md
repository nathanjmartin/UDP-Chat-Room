UDP Chat Room
-----------------------------

* TODO: Abstract chat.py & server.py. This way, the server is handling all the communication between multiple people running chat.py, instead of one of the people technically chatting with server.py
* Use Tkinter to create the UI for the chat room
* ideally would be able to run client on two different machines along with the server running, allowing the users to connect to the server to chat
